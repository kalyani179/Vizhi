            Vizhi is a social initiative aimed at making sustainability a convenient lifestyle and household practice. We represent a proactive response to the climate crisis by harnessing the power of technology and community engagement to create a resource hub for all.
            I had learnt about climate change in school since I was in grade 1. Countless posters, charts and slogans were written to further the cause of the climate action. But until 6th grade, I never really cared for it. It was always a problem so far away or so I believed until I was taken to visit my cityâ€™s garbage dumpyard. Oh, my, how many heaping mounds of garbage there were! And the heat and stench!
